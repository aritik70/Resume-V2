- **Multi-step wizard pattern** using a centralized state management approach in `ResumeBuilder` component
- **Form handling** with React Hook Form and Zod validation for robust data validation
- **Component library** built on Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Routing** handled by Wouter for lightweight client-side navigation
- **State management** using React Query for server state and local component state for form data

### UI/UX Design System
- **Utility-first approach** using Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
